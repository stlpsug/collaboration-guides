# Guidelines for Effective Collaboration
*Inspired by (and forked from) Ride's [Collaboration Guides](https://github.com/ride/collaboration-guides)*

We are a decentralized peer organization and effective communication is one of the most important foundations on which we build our community.  Below you will find a thorough guide to enable your collaboration and empower your peers to solve problems and resolve disputes. These guidelines apply to STLPSUG members.

## What to do if I need help
If you need something, keep in mind that everyone has limted time and resources. Before reaching out, ask yourself:
- has this been asked before?
- Start by searching in github, waffle, gitter history - invest at least 2 minutes in each.
- Is this information for me only, or could other people benefit from it? (to determine if private message, or public forum like gh, etc)
- Is this information sensitive?
    - i.e. keys, passwords, personal information
    - don't share these via email or other unsafe means.
- is it **urgent**?
    - urgent means, something needs to be done in the next ten minutes.
    - if it can wait 1 or two hours, **it is not urgent**
- Am I trying to do [#lazyweb][lazyweb]?

## Preferred communication methods
Sometimes it's easier to look for other people who already possess certain information, but in many cases these same people are trying to concentrate in their day to day work. If after going through the above questions you still need to reach out to someone, start going down the following list of preferred communication methods in increasing urgency order:
- github issue, so information can be shared
  - for general questions/comments/organizational proposals use the main repo found at [here][stlpsug]
  - if it's website specific use the [Web][stlpsug-web] repository.
  - if you don't know what repo means, you're looking for the [organizational waffle][org-waffle]
- [Gitter][gitter]
  - keep in mind your messages may be lost in history
  - don't abuse @channel, or @here or other commands because people stop paying attention

## If someone reaches out for help
- assume good intent
  - expect said person has followed the above process before they reached out to you
  - be patient
- excercise good time management
- assess if the other person is blocked
  - Must they solve this in less than two hours?
  - Are you the only person who has this information? (please document so it's easier next time)
- It is **ok** to say, "I will get back to you in X mins/hours" - `but stick to it`
- If you know where this information is, share the link
- Don't use passive-aggressive language
  - as I/someone else said before/last week/hour/50 times
- Move the conversation to a public forum so others can benefit from knowledge and there is a record for future reference.

## If you notice someone in need of help
- point them in the right direction
- be helpful, or refrain from adding noise to the discussion
- Don't use passive-aggressive language
  - as I/someone else said before/last week/hour/50 times

## Argument or ineffective discussion etiquette over written mediums
- If you're not involved, suggest a phonecall :phone:
- Don't add noise, like jokes or emojis, it makes discussions worse.
- If you are involved, ask for a call.
- Be polite and respectful, always.
- If you are upset, step away for a 10 minute walk and come back.
- If you notice someone else is upset, suggest a break but don't force it.
- Stay away from written mediums when it comes to miscommunications (no email, chat, sms).

## Messaging etiquette
- Use proper subject labels so people can quickly determine your needs from their inbox `i.e., [ack]`, see table below
- If you have a github issue that needs attention, ping the people involved and request an `[ack]@<team or user>`
- Don't use non-specific pronouns when you need assistance
  - People assume others will take the task, so words like `someone`, `anyone`, `folks`, `y'all` are bad practice
  - Assign your request to a specific person or do it yourself, it won't get done otherwise.
  - Don't be afraid of asking others for help, but don't abuse delegation
- Use `team`, `folks`, `peeps` or similar non-gendered pronouns to refer to groups of people
- If there is no github issue, there is no problem. Ask for the creation of one or make it yourself.
- If your email/issue is longer than 2 paragraphs, use a [TL;DR][tldr]
- Include _just enough_ information.
  - Don't add information that would make something harder to process.
  - When in doubt, use [Hemingway App][hemingway].

## Response etiquette
- Act on our common list of subject labels, see table below.
- If your message allows for a longer response time, use label modifiers like [ack-24] or [ack-48] in your subjects, meaning 24 or 48 hours
- If you need a response in less than 4 hours, be mindful of interruptions or ask @michaeltlombardi or @doesitscript first.

#### Acking
- acking (replying to an email with `ack` or an issue/comment with the hooray reaction (:tada:) is an easy way to help others know we're in sync
- where does ack come from in our team? [read this][ack]
- **don't reply all**

#### Subject Labels

|       label       |                      definition                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| [ack]             | sender requires acknowledgement within 12 hours     |
| [broadcast]       | no ack needed                                       |
| [action-needed]   | you need to do something besides reading this thing |
| [response-needed] | you need to reply with something besides ack        |
| [xxxx-24]         | modifies any label to default to 24 normal hours    |
| [xxxx-48]         | 2 days to reply or act upon                         |
| [xxxx-72]         | 3 days to reply or act upon                         |
|                   |                                                     |

## Availability Etiquette

- Steering Committee overall should be generally available within 24 hours (any one member, not all of them)
- `Ack` is a guideline for members, teams must abide by them. Understand that this is a volunteer peer organization, not a job.

## What should I do if someone is not following these guidelines?

- assume it's not intentional
- if it's the first time it happens, you may remind them how we prefer to collaborate by pointing them to this guide privately
- if you don't feel comfortable with the above, talk to someone on the @SteeringCommittee who will help you find a solution

## Final comments

Since there is a [direct relationship between how we communicate and how we perform as a team](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30311/1/Stacey_Hassall_Thesis.pdf), these guidelines aim to make ourselves better as a team, while we build an excellent community and resources. This document is open for discussion and your input is encouraged so we can grow together.
